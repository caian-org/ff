It applies to the current web site only, it is not a global power button.\n\n***\n\nFlexible, it's more than an \"ad blocker\": it can also read and create filters from hosts files.\n\nOut of the box, these lists of filters are loaded and enforced:\n\n- EasyList\n- Peter Lowe’s Ad server list\n- EasyPrivacy\n- Malware domains\n\nMore lists are available for you to select if you wish:\n\n- Fanboy’s Enhanced Tracking List\n- Dan Pollock’s hosts file\n- hpHosts’s Ad and tracking servers\n- MVPS HOSTS\n- Spam404\n- And many others\n\nOf course, the more filters enabled, the higher the memory footprint. Yet, even after adding Fanboy's two extra lists, hpHosts’s Ad and tracking servers, uBlock Origin still has a lower memory footprint than other very popular blockers out there.\n\nAlso, be aware that selecting some of these extra lists may lead to higher likelihood of web site breakage -- especially those lists which are normally used as hosts file.\n\n***\n\nFree.\nOpen source with public license (GPLv3)\nFor users by users.\n\nIf ever you really do want to contribute something, think about the people working hard to maintain the filter lists you are using, which were made available to use by all for free.\n\n***\n\nDocumentation:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin\n\nProject change log:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases\n\nContributors @ Github:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/graphs/contributors\n\nContributors @ Crowdin:\nhttps://crowdin.net/project/ublock","weeklyDownloads":247138,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Raymond Hill","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/user/11423598/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/157/157572.png?modified=1543520531","width":640,"height":480,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/157/157572.png?modified=1543520531","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"Default mode"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/157/157576.png?modified=1543520531","width":640,"height":480,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/157/157576.png?modified=1543520531","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"The dashboard: stock filter lists"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/157/157592.png?modified=1543520532","width":640,"height":480,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/157/157592.png?modified=1543520532","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"Dynamic filtering allows default-deny mode"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/159/159634.png?modified=1543520533","width":640,"height":480,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/159/159634.png?modified=1543520533","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"The dashboard: settings"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/158/158734.png?modified=1543520534","width":700,"height":525,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/158/158734.png?modified=1543520534","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"Unified logger"}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.6979,"reviewCount":3733,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/reviews/","updateDate":1569099278000},{"id":"jid1-BoFifL9Vbdl2zQ@jetpack","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/521/521554-32.png?modified=mcrushed","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/521/521554-64.png?modified=mcrushed","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/521/521554-128.png?modified=mcrushed"},"name":"Decentraleyes","version":"2.0.12","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3048828/decentraleyes-2.0.12-an+fx.xpi?src=","homepageURL":"https://decentraleyes.org","supportURL":"https://decentraleyes.org","description":"Protects you against tracking through \"free\", centralised, content delivery.

is Mozilla's official one :\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/language-tools\n\nAbout ize/ise:\nJust like in other languages, some words can be written differently. Since Oxford says some words are valid both ways, I kept both and the user decides which he prefers. A good example is: \"online\" and \"on-line\".\nFor ize/ise, both ways are accepted in some words:\n— optimize/optimise: https://lexico.com/en/definition/optimize;\n— realize/realise: https://lexico.com/en/definition/realize.\nOxford Dictionaries will only refer that certain words accept both ize/ise for Premium accounts.\nThe regular user won't know by accessing the Oxford site, but I have access to it.\n\nPlaces from New Zealand/UK (England, Scotland, Wales & Northern Ireland):\nOn V2.61–2.64 I included tons of place names.\nMy scientist friend, Peter McGavin, told me that in NZ they use British, so I decided to do something about it. I did the same for UK. I searched on Wikipedia for \"towns\", \"counties\", \"villages\", \"boroughs\", \"suburbs\", etc. and based me on:\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_towns_in_England;\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_towns_in_New_Zealand;\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_civil_parishes_in_England;\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_civil_parishes_in_Scotland;\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_places_in_Scotland;\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_communities_in_Wales;\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_in_Wales;\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_towns_and_villages_in_Northern_Ireland;\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counties_of_Northern_Ireland;\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Suburbs_in_New_Zealand;\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Church_of_Scotland_parishes.\nAlso, added places sent to me by Peter C.:\n© OpenStreetMap contributors: www.openstreetmap.org/copyright.\n© The Clergy of the Church of England Database Project, 2005.\n\nCities from Australia\nOn V2.65 I added the cities in Australia by population, since they are in valid English:\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_Australia_by_population.\n\nCities from US\nOn V2.65 I added tons of cities in the US with a 10 000+ population, since they are in valid English.\nThis list was supplied by Michael Holroyd on Kevin Atkinson's GitHub.\n\nCities from Canada\nOn V2.67 I added the cities in Canada, since they are in valid English:\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_Canada.\n\nCommon prescription and OTC drugs\nOn V2.63 I added tons of drugs names supplied by Andrew Ziem on Kevin Atkinson's GitHub.\nThe generic drugs (such as \"diphenhydramine\") are in lowercase, while the brand names (such as \"Abilify\") are capitalised.\n\nMain difficulties developing this dictionary:\n1) Proper names;\n2) Possessive forms;\n3) Plurals.\n\nAdding new words:\nIf you believe to have found a missing/incorrect word, please send it to me for analysis. If it is on the Oxford or Collins dictionaries, I will add it.\n\nRemoving US words:\nIf you find American words, which appear both in Oxford and Collins dictionaries as such with a British correspondence, please send them to me for analysis and removal.\n\n\nI developed Proofing Tool GUI (open-source tool) hoping someone would improve the GB speller, but months went by and no one volunteered, so I took the task myself in 2013.\n\nI have created the best up-to-date British speller. It encompasses several fields of knowledge, from simple to complex words.\n\nIt doesn't matter your religion, sex, age or academic background, everyone should have access to all words equally for free.\n\nTo make sure the words I add are the correct ones, I have been looking for them in credible sources:\n1) Oxford Dictionaries;\n2) Collins Dictionary;\n3) Macmillan Dictionary;\n4) Cambridge Dictionary;\n5) Merriam-Webster Dictionary (used with caution ⚠);\n6) Wiktionary (used with caution ⚠);\n7) Wikipedia (used with caution ⚠);\n8) Physical dictionaries.\n\nIn January 2015 I purchased an \"Oxford Gold Account\" to have a higher access in Oxford Dictionaries.\n\nI am also involved on several projects with a specific jargon having added some \"special\" words.\n\nI am adding the words with copy/paste after checking them in the dictionaries mentioned above. This is slower and harder, but the results are much better and accurate.\n\nOn 25.Aug.2013 I released a \"forked\" V2.00. The speller has been made available to OpenOffice, LibreOffice, Firefox, Thunderbird and SeaMonkey.
